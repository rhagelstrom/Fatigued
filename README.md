# Fatigued

**Current Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 12/15/2022

5E extension for FantasyGrounds that adds fatigued as a condition as well as immunities to the fatigued condition.

## Combat Fatigue

When a creature is reduced to 0 hit points and then regains consciousness by regaining 1 or more, they suffer a cumulative -1 penalty to their attack rolls, initiative rolls, saving throws, and ability checks (except death saving throws). This penalty can be accumulated a number of times equal to a creatureâ€™s proficiency bonus and disappears when they complete a Short or Long Rest.

When a creature is healed (including when they are being healed from 0 hit points), the creature providing the healing can reduce the amount of healing they provide by 10 points to reduce (or prevent) 1 point of combat fatigue, and if they do so can reduce it further by increments of 5 to remove 1 additional point of combat fatigue for every 5 points.

If a creature is making death saving throws and rolls a natural 20, they immediately recover from combat fatigue.

## Deficiency
This extension does not have the ability to remove Fatigued points on heal.

**Note:** If using SilentRuin's Generic Actions extension, Verify Cast Effect must be set to "off" in that extension.
